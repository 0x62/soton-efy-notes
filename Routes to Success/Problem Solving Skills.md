Problem solving is a 2 step process.

## Thinking

First, **check you understand the problem**, then **devise the strategy**. During this step, there are a few questions you should be asking yourself:

- What are you being asked to find?
- Do you understand all the words in the problem?
- What information and/or relationships are you given in the question?
- Will you need other facts/relationships not explicitly given?

Some information is given explicitly, for example the fact that the mass of a ball is 70kg. Other information is implicit, like the fact that if it is dropped from rest it's initial speed is zero.

It may help to draw a diagram of the problem at the beginning. From this sketch, try to identify the physical processes or forces at work. Labelling the sides and forces will help select the appropriate equations to work with, and the units you should be answering in.

Once you understand the problem, explicit information and implicit information, consider different techniques to solve it. 

## Doing

Once you have determined a technique to solve the problem, **carry it out**. While carrying it out, keep evaluating your intermediate answers â€“ are they getting you closer?

Consider whether you're able to **check your answer** once you reach it (for example, by considering [[SI Units#Assumptions on Ranges [ 1]|assumptions on SI ranges]]). Is the number reasonable? Do the units make sense?
