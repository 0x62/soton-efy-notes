The **E series** is a classification of preferred numbers utilised in electronic components, including resistors, capacitors, inductors, and zener diodes. It comprises several series identified as **E3**, **E6**, **E12**, **E24**, **E48**, **E96**, and **E192**. Each series denotes the quantity of logarithmic value steps available per decade, serving to simplify inventory and manufacturing processes in the electronics industry.

**Key Points**:
- The E series simplifies component selection and inventory management.
- Consists of multiple series with increasing numbers of values.
- Commonly used for resistors, capacitors, inductors, and zener diodes.
- Other components may use Renard series or specific product standards.

| Series | Number of Steps |
|--------|----------------|
| E3     | 3              |
| E6     | 6              |
| E12    | 12             |
| E24    | 24             |
| E48    | 48             |
| E96    | 96             |
| E192   | 192            |
