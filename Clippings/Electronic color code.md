The color band system is a method used to indicate the values of resistors through a series of colored bands printed on their bodies. Each color corresponds to a specific number, and the sequence of colors determines the resistance value and tolerance. Understanding the color code is essential for anyone working with electronic components to ensure proper circuit functionality.

**Key Points:**
- Color bands indicate resistance values and tolerance.
- Each color represents a specific number or multiplier.
- The first two bands denote significant digits, the third band indicates the multiplier, and the fourth denotes tolerance.

| Color  | Number | Multiplier | Tolerance |
| ------ | ------ | ---------- | --------- |
| Brown  | 1      | x10        | ±1%       |
| Red    | 2      | x100       | ±2%       |
| Orange | 3      | x1,000     |           |
| Yellow | 4      | x10,000    |           |
| Green  | 5      | x100,000   | ±0.5%     |
| Blue   | 6      | x1,000,000 | ±0.25%    |
| Violet | 7      |            | ±0.1%     |
| Gray   | 8      |            | ±0.05%    |
| Black  | 0      |            |           |
| Gold   |        | x0.1       | ±5%       |
| Silver |        | x0.01      | ±10%      |
