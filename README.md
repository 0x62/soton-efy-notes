## About me

Hey, I'm [Ben](https://bl.je). Before coming to Southampton I was software engineer/founder. You can connect with me here:

These notes are also available on [Github](https://github.com/0x62/soton-efy-notes). I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write them, and you'll probably want to do the same to read them with links/embeds.

## Tags

### Topics

Most topics in each module get their own tag, so you can find related notes across multiple pages/sections. A non-exhaustive list of tags are below.

| Module                    | Topic             | Tag             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| â€“                         | Required Formulas | #formula        |
| Electricity & Electronics | Circuit Theory    | #circuit-theory |
| Mechanical Science        | Elasticity        | #elasticity     |
| Engineering Principles    | Heat              | #heat           |
| Engineering Principles    | Gases             | #gases          |
### Raw Notes

My lecture notes first go in **Unsorted Notes** before I rewrite and categorise them. They're named according to the date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD), and tagged by module. These notes are likely to be pretty low quality.

| Tag                 | Module                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| #raw-electricity    | Electricity & Electronics |
| #raw-eng-principles | Engineering Principles    |
| #raw-rts            | Routes to Success         |
| #raw-mech           | Mechanical Science        |
| #raw-coursework     | Coursework                |

### Clippings

Sometimes I embed AI summaries of Wikipedia pages (and other sources) to augment notes. These are usually just for extra knowledge so aren't included in the main navigation. You can find clippings under the tag #clippings  if you want to see a list of them all.
