These are my notes from Engineering Foundation Year at University of Southampton, starting from 2025.

## About me

Hey, I'm [Ben](https://bl.je). Before coming to Southampton I was software engineer/founder. You can connect with me here:

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benlewisjsy)
- Github: [0x62](https://github.com/0x62)
- Instagram: [@benlew.is](https://instagram.com/benlew.is)
- Email: ben@bl.je

These notes are also available on [Github](https://github.com/0x62/soton-efy-notes). I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write them, and you'll probably want to do the same to read them with links/embeds.  You'll also want the [Latex Suite](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite) plugin if you want the math to render nicely.

## Tags

### Topics

Most topics in each module get their own tag, so you can find related notes across multiple sections. A non-exhaustive list of tags are below.

| Module                    | Topic             | Tag             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| â€“                         | Required Formulas | #formula        |
| Electricity & Electronics | Circuit Theory    | #circuit-theory |
| Mechanical Science        | Elasticity        | #elasticity     |
### Raw Notes

My lecture notes first go in Unsorted Notes before I rewrite and categorise them. Generally they're named according to the date, and tagged by module. These notes are likely to be pretty low quality.

| Tag                 | Module                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| #raw-electricity    | Electricity & Electronics |
| #raw-eng-principles | Engineering Principles    |
| #raw-rts            | Routes to Success         |
| #raw-mech           | Mechanical Science        |
| #raw-coursework     | Coursework                |
