## Electrical Current
$$
I = \frac{Q}{t}
$$

![[Circuit Theory (1)#Current]]



$$
I = nAve \qquad J = \frac{I}{A}
$$

## Resistance

$$
R = \frac{V}{I} 
$$

![[Circuit Theory (1)#Resistance]]

![[Circuit Theory (2)#Ohm's Law]]

$$
R = \frac{\rho \ell}{a} \qquad R_s = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 \qquad \frac{1}{R_p} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}
\qquad R_p = \frac{R_1 \times R_2}{R_1 + R_2}
$$

## Power & Energy

$$
P = V \times I \qquad P = I^2 \times R \qquad P = \frac{V^2}{R}
$$

![[Circuit Theory (1)#Power]]

$$
W = V \times l \times t
$$
